\begin{abstract}
We present a new technique called \emph{type targeted testing}, 
which translates precise \emph{refinement types} into comprehensive 
test-suites.
%
The key insight behind our approach is that through the lens of SMT
solvers, refinement types can also be viewed as a high-level, 
declarative, test generation technique, wherein types are converted
to SMT queries whose models can be decoded into concrete program inputs.
%
Our approach enables the systematic and exhaustive testing of 
implementations from high-level declarative specifications, and 
furthermore, provides a gradual path from testing to full verification.
%
We have implemented our approach as a Haskell testing tool called 
\toolname, and present an evaluation that shows how \toolname can 
be used to test a wide variety of properties and how it compares 
against state-of-the-art testing approaches.
%% Our results suggest that type targeted testing may be a sweet 
%% spot reconciling expressive and automatic, testing and verification.
